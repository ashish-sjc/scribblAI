# Pictionary / skribbl.io MVP (Sleeker UI)

This scaffold contains a minimal monorepo for an MVP: a React + Vite frontend and a Node + Socket.IO backend implementing real-time drawing and chat for rooms.

Quick start (run each in separate terminals):

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Next steps: wire up game rounds, scoring, word list, AI integrations.
